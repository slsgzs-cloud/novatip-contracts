# novatip-contracts

Soroban smart contracts for **Novatip** — tap-to-tip any creator in seconds, with
tips split across collaborators on-chain and settled in USDC on Stellar.

This repository holds the on-chain core. The backend (`novatip-backend`), web app
(`novatip-web`), shared SDK (`novatip-sdk`), and docs (`novatip-docs`) live in
separate repositories under the same organization.

## Contracts

| Contract | Status | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `tip-splitter` | ✅ v0.1.0 | Receives a tip and splits it across recipients by basis points |
| `supporter-badge` | planned | Non-transferable badge minted to supporters |

See [`docs/CONTRACT.md`](./docs/CONTRACT.md) for the full `tip-splitter` interface.

## Quick start

```bash
# One-time: the Stellar CLI builds contracts for this target
rustup target add wasm32v1-none

# Build all contracts to wasm
make build

# Run the test suite
make test
```

> Without the target installed, `make build` fails with `can't find crate for
> core` — the CLI moved from `wasm32-unknown-unknown` to `wasm32v1-none`.
> `make test` runs natively and works either way.

## Tech

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) + [Soroban SDK](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/build/smart-contracts)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/cli) for build & deploy
- Tips settle in **USDC** (Stellar Asset Contract)

## Network Deployments

| Network | Contract ID | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Testnet | [`CCY2WPXROVUMPYAK3YJHZ57I35JKAUM5GDJKLUF5Y72KGENBQNSYAJIW`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CCY2WPXROVUMPYAK3YJHZ57I35JKAUM5GDJKLUF5Y72KGENBQNSYAJIW) | live |
| Mainnet | coming soon | pending audit |

The testnet deployment settles in the testnet USDC SAC below, and carries a
`@demo` jar splitting 70/30 between two accounts for anyone wanting to try the
read methods without deploying their own.

USDC Stellar Asset Contract addresses:

| Network | USDC SAC |
|---------|----------|
| Testnet | `CBIELTK6YBZJU5UP2WWQEUCYKLPU6AUNZ2BQ4WWFEIE3USCIHMXQDAMA` |
| Mainnet | `CCW67TSZV3SSS2HXMBQ5JFGCKJNXKZM7UQUWUZPUTHXSTZLEO7SJMI75` |
